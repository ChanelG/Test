            <P>Hiiii! I did coding this summer. LOOKIT MY STUFF!!!</P>
        </div>
            <P>So we did a bunch of stuff this summer in Girls Who Code. There were a lot of projects, most of which it took 10+ years for me to finish or not finish at all. But I swear I'm learning things! Here are a few things we did:</p>
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <b>Week One</b>
                    <ul>
                        <a href="shapes.html"><li>Shapes and Squares</li></a>
                        <a href=""><li>Paddle Ball</li></a></ul>
                    <br><b>Week Two</b>
                    <ul>
                        <a href=""><li>Mad Libs</li></a>
                        <a href=""><li>Text Adventure</li></a></ul>
                    <br><b>Week Three</b>
                    <ul>
                        <a href=""><li>Obamicon</li></a>
                        <a href=""><li>Snow Animation</li></a></ul>
                    <br><b>Week Four</b>
                    <ul>
                        <a href=""><li>Piezo Song</li></a>
                        <a href=""><li>Robot Dance</li></a></ul>
                </ul>
            <p>Those were only some of the things we did. Trust me, there are a lot more but I'm too lazy to write all that stuff so uh yeah. I'm really proud of the Snow Animation project because it took a while but I didn't stop trying and I didn't have to copy anyone else's code!... Not that I've ever done that before... Take a peek!</p>
